## Usage
No user input is required. The module will automatically flag Battered Oath infusion materials that meet the specified minimum power stat line amount threshold. By default, this is set to 3 lines.

 Any piece that meets the threshold will display the masterwork badge for ease of discovery. Any piece below the threshold will be displayed as enigmatic for ease of infusing. 

The number of power rolls is displayed as the enchantment number so you don't have to mouse-over every single item to check.
